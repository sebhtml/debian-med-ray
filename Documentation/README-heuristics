The heuristics enables Ray to build paths in the graph.

Choosers implement heuristics. They are:

- OpenAssembler (OpenAssembler.cpp) glues other choosers together
- NovaEngine (RayNovaEngine.cpp) for mate-pairs (experimental)
- PairedChooser (Chooser.cpp) for short outer distances
- BubbleChooser (BubbleTool.cpp) for heterozygous sites (experimental)
- TipChooser (TipWatchDog.cpp) to dodge these tips that seem good from paired data
