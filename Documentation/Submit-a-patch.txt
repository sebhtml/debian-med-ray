If you want to contribute, clone the git repository, make changes
and I (SÃ©bastien Boisvert) will pull from you after reviewing
the code changes. You can use "Fork/Pull request" on github for
that.

You can also submit a signed-off patch.

=== A good patch ===

A patch should:

- be concise
- address one issue/bug/feature (not many)
    (in that case, submit more than one patch)
- should compile cleanly with -std=c++98 (or -ansi) -Wall with g++


- should pass all system tests
- should pass all unit tests
