You need:

	- A C++ compiler (C++ 1998 or later)
	- An MPI implementation
	- make

== Quickstart on GNU/Linux ==

On GNU/Linux, you can use GNU C++ (g++) and Open-MPI.

Then, type

make PREFIX=ray-build
make install
ls ray-build

mpiexec -n 1 ray-build/Ray -o test -p test_1.fastq test_2.fastq -k 31


== Options ==

You can provide compilation options to the Makefile.

MPICXX			The path to the C++ compiler wrapper (usually called mpicxx)
PREFIX			Where to install stuff
MAXKMERLENGTH		maximum k-mer length, default is MAXKMERLENGTH=32
FORCE_PACKING		save memory by not aligning addresses, default is FORCE_PACKING=n
ASSERT			run assertions too, default is ASSERT=n


For other options, read the Makefile header.


== Working compilers ==

Anything that supports C++ 1998.
