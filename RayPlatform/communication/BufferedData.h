/**
 *  This class accumulates messages and flush them when the threshold is reached.
 *
 *  Messages are added in a periodic manner, and 4096 (-) something is the _real_ threshold.
 *  Currently, MAXIMUM_MESSAGE_SIZE_IN_BYTES is 4000. Therefore, it is assumed that 96 bytes 
 *  is an upper bound for the required space for a message's enveloppe.
 *
 *  for instance, if messages are of size 3 and the MAX_SIZE is 10,
 *  then you want the threshold to be 9, that is 10/3*3 because else
 *  at 9 it won't get flushed, and the next thing you know is that you are at 12,
 *  this is above the threshold and the RingAllocator does not allow that.
